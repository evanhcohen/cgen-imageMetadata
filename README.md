EXIF is a format for adding metadata  to jpeg files.
The metadata could contain details like: camera name, lenses name, exposure time etc.
Among those details it contains a detail named "datetime_original".

You will recive a number of jpg images. You should write a code that go over said images and print the name of images
that were taken during the evening.

You can use Internet, any python library - anything you want.
